<blockquote>
<p>so some family had some medical issues and thus they needed to go to a hospital asap. cologne had the best hospital in the closest range, and thus they went there and since i could, i joined them and tried to see some parts of cologne itself.</p>

<h2 id="chistmas-vibes">chistmas vibes</h2>
<p>since i went there from 18-12 till 21-12, i saw a lot of christmas stuff (for pictures, check the pictures section on <a href="https://ahwx.org/pix">my website</a>, they’ll be uploaded soon. (note from 2024, they’re not and most likely will not be uploaded.))</p>
<p>there was even a little ice skating on one of the “platze”, and there were a lot of little kids. the smiles of kids make me feel quite sad since i had that smile too when i was 3, and school took it al away. i love how kids can smile and can be happy with little things.</p>
<p>there also were a lot of little christmas lights and some people even decorated their baby pram thingies, how cute! :)</p>
<h2 id="environmental-stuff">environmental stuff</h2>
<p>there were not too many homeless people as far as i’ve seen (i’ve seen stuff in corners for about 4 people i think, and one actual homeless guy), which is good of course, in contrast to another big city in germany (berlin), there where a lot less homeless people.</p>
<p>there where not too many people begging, i’ve seen about 10 i think.</p>
<p>there was also a little (not much) less smoking than in berlin (in all big cities, a shit ton of people smoke, and i dont know why. i saw this when i was in toronto, berlin, detroit, dublin and amsterdam).</p>
<p>there was quite a lot of trash on the ground, especially in the bahnhoff places.</p>
<h2 id="people">people</h2>
<p>i’ve noticed a lot of nice people, but also quite a few people (in restaurants specifically) that were a little agressive to their customers.</p>
<p>in general, the people were very nice.</p>
<h2 id="historical-places">historical places</h2>
<p>i’ve been to the dom, a historical city wall thingy, a few old departs of the city, and i took a lot of pictures.</p>
<h2 id="zoo">zoo</h2>
<p>of course, i also went to the “Kolner Zoo”, and there were my favorite animals! monkeys and pinguins! also there were giraffes, rhino’s, a lot of fish, some bears, some other typical animals and even see lions :)</p>
<h2 id="overal-thoughts">overal thoughts</h2>
<p>even thought i stayed in a hotel in a little worse depart of the city, it was very nice to see a big city once again, and going out of my little hometown.</p>
<p>pros: a lot of historical stuff, a lot of nice places and people to go to, a lot of nice food (schnitzels :]), overal quite a safe city afaik</p>
<p>cons: smoking is popular, not as clean in every depart, quite slow mobile connectivity (4g, is not really a con for me, but for some it might be), going somewhere is always expensive</p>
<p>rating from me: 7/10</p>  </div> </main>  </div> <meta name="astro-view-transitions-enabled" content="true"><meta name="astro-view-transitions-fallback" content="animate">
