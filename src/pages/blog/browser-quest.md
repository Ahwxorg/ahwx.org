# The quest for a good browser

## Why

So this began when I tried to use ungoogled-chromium and found out that they do some not-so-cool manifest stuff. The obvious solution was using another browser, but, all of the browsers I tried had issues. I tried:

## Firefox

Firefox does not seem to like Vimium and I need that, the rest of Firefox is awesome.

## Safari

Safari does not have anything like Vimium except Vimari made by peppy, the creator of osu!. It's pretty nice, except it does not include any of the shortcuts I want.

## Orion

Orion does not like Vimium. Neither as a Firefox nor Chromium plugin.

## Arc

Arc hitted me with a "sign in pwease we need your data pwetty pwease" and I don't want that :L

## Opera (GX)

Spyware.

## Other browser xyz?

I did not know any other browsers, and so I am still using ungoogled-chromium at the moment. Please help :P
