# Why Discord is bad

> Because I think this is very important, please share any other information with me using my [contact information](https://ahwx.org/contact).

* Discord has changed their ToS to allow them to record your voice/video/screensharing. See screenshow below.

* Discord itself requires running a closed source client/program on your computer/browser. That alone is a reason for me to only run it in the browser unless I really need to run it on my computer.

* Discord reportedly collects lots of data about users. There is no way to prove this wrong, as Discord is closed source.

* Discord requires phone number verification when logging in over Tor and VPNs

* Users report that Discord [shut off their accounts](https://r.ahwx.org/r/discordapp/comments/7y71y6/account_disabled/) and [won't tell them why](https://r.ahwx.org/r/discordapp/comments/7arzdn/my_account_has_been_disabled_with_no_reason_given/). I myself have seen this happen numerous times.

I myself will not be using Discord (regularly) after they change their ToS at 2023-03-26.
