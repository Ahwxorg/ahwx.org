# Introducing Linkbase

## What?

[Linkbase](https://docs.ahwx.org) is trying its best to be a huge list of links on subjects I read about.

## Why?

It started with [the quest for a good browser](/browser-quest). As of writing this, I have 236 tabs open. Since I dislike having this much tabs open (mainly because that "forces" me to use a browser), I tried some alternatives such as bookmarks etc, but I found bookmarks a bit broad. When I found VitePress, a very cool static site generator. I tried playing around with it and thus I made a bookmark place for myself and possibly others.
